2. window.addEventListener('scroll', function(event) {
     console.log(event);
});
What is "scroll" in this context?
an event to trigger

an event to listen for
none of these

3. If the event handlers are set to bubble, what happens when the user clicks on element 1?
------------------------------------
| document                         |
|   ---------------  ------------  |
|   | element1    |  | element2 |  |
|   ---------------  ------------  |
|                                  |
------------------------------------

element1.onclick = doSomething;
element2.onclick = doSomething;
document.onclick = defaultFunction;

doSomething() is executed.
defaultFunction() is executed.
doSomething() is executed. defaultFunction() is executed.
doSomething() is executed. doSomething() is executed. defaultFunction() is executed.
EXPLANATION
In event bubbling, after an event triggers on the deepest possible element, it then triggers on parents in nesting order.

The opposite of bubbling is capturing, when the parent elements are triggered before the target element. The EventTarget.addEventListener() defaults to bubbling. You will need to set the useCapture parameter to true to enable capturing.

4. If you insert JavaScript directly into an HTML document with the <script> tag, where should you put it to make sure it runs after the page loads?
Just after the <head> tag.
Just after the <body> tag.
Just before the closing </body> tag.
Just before the closing </html> tag.
EXPLANATION
Browsers read HTML files from the top down. Although scripts can be placed anywhere in a file, weve placed the <script> tags at the end of the document.
This makes the page appear to load faster to the end user because the JavaScript is not blocking the content from rendering.

document.getElementById('demo').textContent = 'Hello World!';

$(document).textContent = 'Hello World!';
EXPLANATION
Because there may be multiple <p> elements, we want to target this element specifically by itâ€™s ID using getElementbyID().
